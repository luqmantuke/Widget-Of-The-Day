Today is 17-Sep-2021 and here is the list of widget I learned and practiced.

1. AbsorbPointer
   - A widget that disables clicking of widgets like buttons.
2. AlertDialog
   - A widget that creates alert to inform the user
3. Align
   - A widget that aligns its child within itself and optionally sizes itself based on the child's size using x and y works best
4. AnimatedAlign
   - Animated version of Align which automatically transitions the child's position over a given duration whenever the given alignment changes.
5. AnimatedBuilder
   - A general-purpose widget for building animations. AnimatedBuilder is useful for more complex widgets that wish to include an animation as part of a larger build function. To use AnimatedBuilder, simply construct the widget and pass it a builder function.
