# Widget-Of-The-Day
This is a Flutter Challenge inspired by Widget Of The Week(Flutter Team). I challenge myself to learn 10 new widgets and practice them everyday.

# How It Works
Everyday I create a new folder which is named by the particular day example 17-Sept-21. Inside each day contains two files <br>
1. <b> day.txt </b><br>
This is a text file where it gives a description of the day and the list of widgets learned and practiced. <br>

2. <b> main.dart </b><br>
This is a dart file where it shows the actual code of the widgets learned. <br>
