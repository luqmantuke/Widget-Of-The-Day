Today is 27-Sep-2021 and here is the list of widget I learned and practiced.

1. Dismissible
   - A widget that can be dismissed by dragging in the indicated direction. Dragging or flinging this widget in the DismissDirection causes the child to slide out of view. Following the slide animation, if resizeDuration is non-null, the Dismissible widget animates its height (or width, whichever is perpendicular to the dismiss direction) to zero over the resizeDuration.



2. Divider 
   - A thin horizontal line, with padding on either side. In the material design language, this represents a divider. Dividers can be used in lists, Drawers, and elsewhere to separate content. To create a divider between ListTile items, consider using ListTile.divideTiles, which is optimized for this case.
 

3. Draggable
   - A widget that can be dragged from to a DragTarget. When a draggable widget recognizes the start of a drag gesture, it displays a feedback widget that tracks the user's finger across the screen. If the user lifts their finger while on top of a DragTarget, that target is given the opportunity to accept the data carried by the draggable.

4. DragTarget
   - A widget that receives data when a Draggable widget is dropped. When a draggable is dragged on top of a drag target, the drag target is asked whether it will accept the data the draggable is carrying. If the user does drop the draggable on top of the drag target (and the drag target has indicated that it will accept the draggable's data), then the drag target is asked to accept the draggable's data.

5. DraggableScrollableSheet
   - A container for a Scrollable that responds to drag gestures by resizing the scrollable until a limit is reached, and then scrolling.
