Today is 04-Oct-2021 and here is the list of widget I learned and practiced.

1. Drawer
   - Drawers are typically used with the Scaffold.drawer property. The child of the drawer is usually a ListView whose first child is a DrawerHeader that displays status information about the current user. The remaining drawer children are often constructed with ListTiles, often concluding with an AboutListTile.



2. DrawerHeader 
   - The top-most region of a material design drawer. The header's child widget, if any, is placed inside a Container whose decoration can be passed as an argument, inset by the given padding.
 

3. DropdownButton
   - A material design button for selecting from a list of items. A dropdown button lets the user select from a number of items. The button shows the currently selected item as well as an arrow that opens a menu for selecting another item.



4. ElevatedButton
   - A Material Design elevated button. A filled button whose material elevates when pressed.
