Today is 20-Sep-2021 and here is the list of widget I learned and practiced.

1. BottomNavigationBar
   - A material widget that's displayed at the bottom of an app for selecting among a small number of views, typically between three and five. The bottom navigation bar consists of multiple items in the form of text labels, icons, or both, laid out on top of a piece of material. It provides quick navigation between the top-level views of an app. For larger screens, side navigation may be a better fit.

2. BottomSheet 
   - What is BottomSheet Flutter?
BottomSheet is a built-in widget in Flutter. This widget is very useful in many situations, such as when you want to present some information, display a menu, show a form with text fields, etc. 

3. Card
   - A material design card: a panel with slightly rounded corners and an elevation shadow. A card is a sheet of Material used to represent some related information, for example an album, a geographical location, a meal, contact details, etc.

4. Center
   - A widget that centers its child within itself. This widget will be as big as possible if its dimensions are constrained and widthFactor and heightFactor are null. If a dimension is unconstrained and the corresponding size factor is null then the widget will match its child's size in that dimension

5. Checkbox
   - The checkbox itself does not maintain any state. Instead, when the state of the checkbox changes, the widget calls the onChanged callback. Most widgets that use a checkbox will listen for the onChanged callback and rebuild the checkbox with a new value to update the visual appearance of the checkbox.
